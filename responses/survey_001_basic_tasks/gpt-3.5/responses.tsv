This query selects the lineage and the count of sequences for each lineage in Asia during 2022. It groups the results by lineage and orders them by count in descending order. Finally, it limits the results to the top 5 most prevalent lineages. 

Here's the JSON response:

```

S001_9_2_3	"Here's the SQL query to answer your question:

```
select date_trunc('month', date) as month, avg(count) as mean_sequences
from (
    select date, count(*) as count
    from metadata
    where country = 'Brazil'
    group by date
) as counts
group by month;
```

This query first groups the sequences by date and counts the number of sequences for each date. Then, it calculates the mean number of sequences per month by grouping the counts by month and taking the average. The result will be a table with two columns: ""month"" and ""mean_sequences"". 

Here's the JSON response:

```
{
    ""sql"": ""select date_trunc('month', date) as month, avg(count) as mean_sequences from ( select date, count(*) as count from metadata where country = 'Brazil' group by date ) as counts group by month;""
