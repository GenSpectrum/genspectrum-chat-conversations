RW_446	I can help you with questions related to the LAPIS database. You can ask me to translate your questions into SQL queries that can be executed on the LAPIS database. The queries will retrieve information about SARS-CoV-2 sequences, samples, variants, and mutations.		false	
RW_447	"Here's your SQL query:

```
select lineage, count(*) from metadata where country = 'Israel' and date between '2023-01-19' - interval '3 months' and '2023-04-19' group by lineage order by count(*) desc;
```

This query will return the most prevalent lineages in Israel in the last 3 months based on the Nextclade lineage classification. The result will be sorted in descending order by the count of sequences for each lineage. 

Note that I assumed today's date is 2023-04-19. If that's not the case, please adjust the date range accordingly. 

Here's your JSON response:

```

This query will return the most prevalent lineage in Israel in the last 35 days based on the metadata table. However, note that the query is based on the lineage column in the metadata table, not the Nextclade classification. If you want to filter by Nextclade classification, you will need to provide more information on how that information is stored in the database."		false
